# Roadmap

The roadmap here is a living document of where the client-facing app is intending to go and things needed to be done in the near future. Since we can't really predict the best way of doing things, this may be flexible and subject to change.

## Timeline
With the feedback from past web editors, the list of features the web team has to deal with increased greatly. There's a lot of ambition, but the progress is going to be slow and steady so as to not completely burn out the department.

## Short term goals
These goals should be tackled as a priority.

* Media section on the homepage
* Fixing the outdated articles in recommended/column
* Bios on every writer's pages
* Styling Update(discuss with the rest of the Spec team)


## Long term goals
These goals are more difficult to give a timeline for. They are in no order of difficulty.
* Newsletter for subscribers via email.
* Migrating to TypeScript
* Optimizing the bundle file
* Migration of the database to SQLite
* Conversion of HOCs to hooks
* Optimization of code in general (removal of outdated code, optimization, etc)
* Fine grained analytics- views per article, time and percent of read, overall site data.
* Worldbeat on the homepage
* More article designs and more control over designs for writers.

## Backlog
The backlog covers features that aren't long-term goals but would be useful to have.
* Offer offline capability either on the website or by an app for readers taking the subway.
